# Discussion Topics

## Board Appointments

Mr. Flores was welcomed unanimously by all in attendance to continue in his role as Board Member. 

Mr. Moore moved, and Mr. Weber seconded, to appoint Ms. Holland-Jauregui to the board as Secretary. With unanimous approval, the motion carried. 

## Non-Profit Status

Mr. Moore reported that former board member Michael Evans will process 501(c)3 renewal paperwork this year as a courtesy; however, Mr. Evans will not be able to provide continued support after that. Mr. Moore will shadow Mr. Evans and will assume responsibility for either performing or coordinating non-profit filings as well as any necessary record-keeping to support such duties.

Mr. Flores moved, and Mr. Weber seconded, to store all documents related to non-profit filings in a dedicated folder on the Uncoded shared Google Drive. The board unanimously approved this motion. Mr. Reeder agreed to contact former board member Mike Stewart for access to Google Drive. 

## Governance Documents

Ms. Palmer shared that she had conducted a preliminary review of the governance documents publicly available at uncoded.org, and that she is in the process of drafting the constitution and bylaws for the organization. 

Mr. Moore moved, and Ms. Holland-Jauregui seconded, that the bylaws include the following provisions regarding organization inititatives:

+ Each initiative shall have two leads
+ Initiative leads must present their personal/work/school schedule to the board for review
+ Initiative leads are not required to serve on the Uncoded board
+ New initiatives and major changes to existing initiatives require board approval

The motion was met with some dissent and was ultimately tabled in favor of assigning bylaws development to a subcommittee.

Mr. Flores moved, and Ms. Holland-Jauregui seconded, to form a subcommittee to review and finalize organization governance documents. With unanimous approval, the motion carried. Ms. Palmer volunteered to lead the Governance Documents Subcommittee, with support from Mr. Moore, Ms. Holland-Jauregui, Mr. Flores, and Mr. Reeder. Ms. Palmer encouraged all in attendance to email her with any questions, comments, or request for addition to bylaws. 

Mr. Pilcher moved that all governance documents are presented to the board by the next meeting, tentatively planned for late November. Mr. Flores seconded the motion, and with no objections, the motion carried. 

## Board Meeting Logistics

Mr. Pilcher moved, and Mr. Weber seconded, to hold board meetings once a month, alternating in-person and electronic meetings. Mr. Moore proposed that the board meet twice a month, alternating mandatory and optional. The chair called for a vote which resulted in a tie. Mr. Pilcher revised his motion to propose that board meetings shall be held once a month in person. This motion was seconded by Mr. Reeder and appproved unanimously by the board.
