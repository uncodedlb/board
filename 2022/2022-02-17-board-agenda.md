# Standing Topics / Old Business
 
- Should quarterly meetings be the way forward?  
    A. More time to focus on goals.  (Annual Requirement)
    B. Might be easier to get sidetracked. (Describe ourselves, create visibility).
- Should there be planned hacknights or should hacknights be planned events?  
    A. Bringing back demostrations might accomplish this.  
- Would an "action item" for the whole board be more conducive to goals?  
    A. Year at a glance
    B. Finding our purpose

    Suggestion (Trish) Cal State Institute of Innovation
    Multinational at the end of August

> Layout a way to get things done in a committee  
- Where is the paperwork that Steve filed away?  
    A. Circle back to Steve to find said paperwork or its trail.  
- Getting a study session group together?  
    A. Potentially in Adaept's space. Contact Jacob.  
    B. AMA? A potential for study session group or for hacknights in the future.  
    C. See if we can access loaner devices.  

- Figure if we want to get involved with the Mesh Network Project and see how it might be done.
- Find out a way to reach out to more people who want to get involved with Uncoded.  
    A. reddit (Likely a very limited audience would be reached. Probably not ideal at this time).  
    B. Posters (Very good option; ideal reach and quite localized.)   
    C. Email (Chain letter option briefly discussed.)  
    D. Newsletter (Wordpress to be pursued by Kennedy.)  
    E. School (Are we still involved? How can we get back to this avenue in the future?)
